**How to Use the News Scrapper:**
1. Make sure to have Git Bash and Conda installed and working on your system.
2. Download the requirement.yaml file.
3. Run this command in git bash, "conda env create -f requirement.yaml.
4. Download the input.txt and main.py files and put them in a directory.
5. Navigate to that directory through Git Bash and enter the command "python main.py".
6. This should automatically scrap the news articles and save them to 5 seperate files.
7. To add or change what articles it scraps, either add new urls to the input.txt page seperated by new lines or replace the existing urls with new ones.

**What this Program Does:**
 This programs purpose is to scrap down new's articles to only their usable text. While this program does not do much on it's own at the moment, it will be expanded later on to include additional functionality.
