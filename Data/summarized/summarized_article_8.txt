"Why the Favorability of Presidential Candidates May Not Determine the Outcome of the 2024 Election"
According to recent polling data, both former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden are viewed unfavorably by a majority of Americans for the 2024 presidential election. This unusual scenario raises questions about the significance of candidate favorability in predicting election outcomes, especially when both candidates are unpopular. Historical data shows that the candidate with the higher net favorability rating does not always win, as intense dislike towards candidates can influence voter choices. Additional polling data suggests that Biden may not be at a disadvantage compared to Trump, despite his lower favorability rating, due to the intensity of negative feelings towards each candidate. Voter sentiment towards candidates' favorability may play a crucial role in the 2024 election, particularly with the increasing polarization in American politics.
